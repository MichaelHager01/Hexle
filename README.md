# Hexle

This is a website I am currently working on, starting 1/16/2023, and wanting to complete by the end of this school semester. This website will combine the idea of wordle with guesing colors hex codes. This has been done before, but I am working on this as my personal semester project to challege myself outside schooling. I will be updating the code as I go.
